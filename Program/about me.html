<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Often, students struggle with their work and rely on tutoring, 
but tuition classes have become very expensive. Especially during COVID,
many schools went online and even completely virtual leaving students to learn
content on their own. We've created a program that connects students aged 7-13 to high
school and college tutors around the world. These tutors teach their students subjects
like Science, Math, and English.</p>



<p>Education is one of the most important aspects of success, 
and it is becoming more expensive and less accessible which is 
unacceptable and it needs to change. All of our bright tutors
are very qualified and are willing to help students out with any 
subjects they are having trouble with. Educationist supports the UN's
Development Goal Four of "[ensuring] inclusive and equitable quality
education and [promoting] lifelong learning opportunities for all"</p>
